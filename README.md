# battery_simulation_dashboard

### **Scenario**:

I am a hybrid battery engineer and data engineer working on an advanced system for a **Battery Analytics Platform**. My goal is to combine your domain expertise in batteries with cutting-edge data engineering practices to create a scalable solution for simulating, analyzing, and visualizing battery performance. The system must handle large-scale simulations, store and process the data efficiently, and deliver actionable insights to end users via APIs and dashboards.

### **Project: Advanced Battery Analytics Platform**

### **Objectives**

1. **Battery Simulation and Metrics**:
    - Use **PyBaMM** to simulate various battery models (e.g., "DFN", "SPM").
    - Implement battery-specific metrics (e.g., State of Health, Cycle Efficiency, Capacity Fade).
    - Enable long-term degradation predictions.
2. **Data Engineering Pipeline**:
    - Build a scalable **ETL pipeline**:
        - Extract raw simulation results.
        - Transform results into processed data with advanced metrics.
        - Load the data into a **PostgreSQL database**.
3. **Backend (FastAPI)**:
    - Develop REST APIs for:
        - Triggering simulations.
        - Retrieving raw and processed data.
        - Querying insights based on user-defined filters (e.g., battery model, date range).
4. **Interactive Dashboard**:
    - Build a **Streamlit** or **Plotly Dash** dashboard to:
        - Run new simulations.
        - View simulation history and compare models.
        - Visualize advanced insights like degradation trends.
5. **Scalability and Containerization**:
    - Use **Docker** to containerize the entire solution.
    - Orchestrate services using **docker-compose** (backend, dashboard, database).
6. **Testing and Version Control**:
    - Implement unit tests for battery simulations, database queries, and APIs.
    - Use **Git** to track your work and write a detailed `README.md` for documentation.
